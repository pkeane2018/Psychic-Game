# Psychic Game
In this game, the player must guess a letter that has been randomly generated by the program.

## How to run the site
The repository can be cloned by clicking the Clone or Download button on the main repository page, then clicking the button next to the url which appears below. Then open a Terminal or Git Bash window, navigate to the location where you want to place the cloned repository, then type 'git clone' and then paste the repository that was just copied. The site can then be opened by clicking on the index.html file and opening it in a web browser. 

## How to Play
First, a random letter is generated. The user types guesses on the keyboard, the program captures these key presses and compares each of them to the randomly generated letter. Each of these guesses is appended to a div. After 9 incorrect guesses, a message is displayed informing the user that he or she has lost and the the number of losses increases by 1, If the player types the randomly generated letter before using up 9 guesses, a message is displayed telling the user that he or she has won and the number of wins increases by 1. After the player either wins or loses, the div with guessed letters is cleared, the number of guesses left is reset to 9, and a new random letter is chosen. The player can continue to play, with the program keeping track of the number of wins and losses.
